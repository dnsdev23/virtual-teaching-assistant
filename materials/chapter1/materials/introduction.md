# Chapter 1: Machine Learning Introduction

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Uses unlabeled data to find patterns
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, t-SNE

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics

## Key Concepts

- **Feature**: An individual measurable property of an observed phenomenon
- **Model**: A mathematical representation of a real-world process
- **Training**: The process of teaching the algorithm using training data
- **Validation**: Testing the model on unseen data to evaluate performance

## Common Applications

1. Image Recognition
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Recommendation Systems
4. Fraud Detection
5. Autonomous Vehicles
